# AGENTS.md: rules for every agent in this repo

## Commands (use only these)
make setup · make check · make ci · make test · make e2e · make eval

## Default stack (don't change without an ADR)
- Backend: Python 3.12, FastAPI, Postgres, pytest
- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript, Playwright for E2E
- Local services: Podman / Compose

## Where things live
docs/PRD.md = what & why · docs/ARCHITECTURE.md = how
docs/stories/ = one file per ticket · docs/adr/ = decisions
docs/STATE.md = current status and decisions: read it first

## Hard rules
1. One ticket = one branch = one PR. Never push to main. Never merge.
2. Write tests first, from the story's Given/When/Then.
3. `make ci` must pass before you open a PR.
4. Never weaken or delete a test to make it pass. Never turn off lint or type checks.
5. A new dependency needs one line in the PR saying why.
6. No secrets in code, logs, tickets or PRs.
7. Don't change .github/ unless the ticket says so.
8. Stuck after 2 tries: set the ticket to blocked and explain what you tried.

## Data rules
Project data class: PUBLIC | INTERNAL | CONFIDENTIAL-LOCAL-ONLY
CONFIDENTIAL-LOCAL-ONLY: only the local model endpoint below. No paid APIs.

## Local model endpoint (for AI features and tests)
http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1   model: local-qwen

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
